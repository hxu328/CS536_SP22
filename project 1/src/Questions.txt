Question 1: In this situation, HashMap is preferable since it is faster than TreeMap when we add and search elements (O(1) for HashMap, O(log(n) for TreeMap). However, TreeMap is more space efficient than HashMap, thus, when we consider more on space efficiency, then TreeMap is preferable.
Question 2: I chosen LinkedList for the implementation, because it is more efficient for adding or removing HashMaps at the index 0 of the list, which are the operations needed for SymTable. In detail, the time complexity of such operations is O(1) when using LinkedList, and O(n) when using ArrayList, where n is the length of the list.
